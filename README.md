# Nymph - collaborative app data

This used to be a package for Composer to include both `sciactive/nymph-server` and `sciactive/nymph-pubsub`. As of Nymph version 2.0, this package will no longer be updated. Instead, you should install nymph-server and nymph-pubsub directly.

```sh
composer require sciactive/nymph-server
composer require sciactive/nymph-pubsub
```
